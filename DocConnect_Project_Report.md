## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Overview

DocConnect is a comprehensive healthcare appointment management system designed to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers. The system facilitates seamless appointment booking, management, and communication between patients, doctors, and administrators through a modern web-based platform.

### 1.2 Project Background

In today's fast-paced healthcare environment, traditional appointment booking methods often lead to inefficiencies, long waiting times, and poor patient experience. The COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the need for digital healthcare solutions that can reduce physical contact while maintaining quality care delivery.

### 1.3 System Architecture

The DocConnect system is built using a modern three-tier architecture:

- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS for responsive user interface
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for RESTful API services
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible data storage
- **Admin Panel**: Separate React.js application for administrative functions

### 1.4 Key Stakeholders

1. **Patients**: End users who book appointments and manage their healthcare
2. **Doctors**: Healthcare providers who manage their schedules and patient appointments
3. **Administrators**: System managers who oversee operations and user management

### 1.5 Project Timeline

The project was developed over multiple phases:
- Phase 1: Core functionality and user authentication
- Phase 2: Appointment booking and management
- Phase 3: Admin panel and doctor management
- Phase 4: Profile management and UI enhancements
- Phase 5: Testing and optimization
